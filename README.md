## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi there and welcome to my public profile!

My name is Jason, and I'm a Data Scientist at the [Reece Group](https://group.reece.com/au). I now find myself doing less on "the tools" and more in the leadership space, so my personal projects are a nice way to keep some of my technical skills sharp!
